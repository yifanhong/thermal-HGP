The primary simulation and plotting code is inside the Jupyter notebook "Thermal memory.ipynb". The simulation code specific to the hypergraph product of tree Ising models is inside "quantum_Ising_tree.ipynb".

Note that the code uses an older version (v0.1.60) of the python LDPC package (https://pypi.org/project/ldpc/) and some functions are renamed in the latest versions (v2.0-).
